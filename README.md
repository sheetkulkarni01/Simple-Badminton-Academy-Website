# Lord of Strings Badminton Academy

## üìò Project Description

A responsive website for a badminton academy built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The homepage links to sections such as Hall of Fame, Academy Details, About, Mission and Vision, Registration Form, and Contact. The interface includes scrolling text, image galleries, styled content via CSS, and real-time validation using JavaScript. PHP handles data storage from the registration form into a local database via XAMPP. Media assets like player images and logos are organized in an "images" folder. The site enables online registration, displays batch schedules and fees, and celebrates notable alumni. Future enhancements include video sessions and online payment integration.
